          Especially to all the bingsu lovers out there. They&apos;ve got
          several choices of flavour which none are too sweet so it&apos;s also
          a perfect place for the older audience as well. Service wise, super
          friendly staff especially the young couple which are actually the
          owners of the place! Very attentive and are also super helpful to give
          suggestions if you&apos;re not sure what to try. Bingsu wise: Hoji Cha
          10/10 - As a hojicha lover this hit the spot perfectly, with the
          alternative oatmilk option it was super rich in flavour but also
          balanced so it wasn&apos;t too much. Roasted Soybean 10/10 - Slightly
          a bit on the sweeter side but balanced out perfectly with the cream
          cheese. Matcha 9/10 - Full of matcha flavour on every taste, would
          definitely satisfy the matcha lovers. Generally a great spot to visit
          with friends and family for dessert after a meal. Have heard nothing
          but complements when bringing people to try for the first time (and
          like me becoming regulars after)

          Love their hojicha bingsu!!! By far the richest taste I&apos;ve tried!
          And every time I come here this is a confirmed repeat order. (This is
          my 4th time here alreadyüôà) I also like their - oolong peach (imagine
          a chagee but shaved ice version üòç) - soybean (you will love it if u
          like injeolmi) - matcha Each bingsu comes with 3-4 toppings. U can
          also modify ur toppings. But I think the combination is already good
          so I never modify. Environment is chill and cozy, also provide
          drinking water. Overall a perfect hangout place with ur friends and
          family with good dessert!

          Tried Binq for the first time and had a pleasant experience. Flavors
          were different than other bingsu places, worth trying because so far
          no other places has these flavours, it&apos;s always the same old
          thing (always green tea..oreo or yogurt) so this is something
          refreshing. Appreciate the fact that we can change toppings if we
          like. Space was quite clean, if there&apos;s any space to improve..the
          tables were a little sticky. I noticed the guy owner cleaning up
          constantly, looking around and keeping the place neat - which is
          really rare, impressive and much appreciated. Usually bingsu places
          (and even many cafes in general) are kinda dirty and messy, the staff
          don&apos;t really pay attention to customer service and leave it all
          to their customers to do everything but the guy owner here was very
          detailed and helped removed our bowls and trays once we were done so
          my friends and I could chat more comfortably. Really, really
          appreciate that and hope that he keeps up the good work. It&apos;s
          quite rare to have someone be proactive and pay attention to details
          like that. Nice place to chill and portions were good too, would come
          back again.
