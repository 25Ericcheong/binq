          Especially to all the bingsu lovers out there. They&apos;ve got
          several choices of flavour which none are too sweet so it&apos;s also
          a perfect place for the older audience as well. Service wise, super
          friendly staff especially the young couple which are actually the
          owners of the place! Very attentive and are also super helpful to give
          suggestions if you&apos;re not sure what to try. Bingsu wise: Hoji Cha
          10/10 - As a hojicha lover this hit the spot perfectly, with the
          alternative oatmilk option it was super rich in flavour but also
          balanced ...

          Love their hojicha bingsu!!! By far the richest taste I&apos;ve tried!
          And every time I come here this is a confirmed repeat order. (This is
          my 4th time here already) I also like their - oolong peach (imagine a
          chagee but shaved ice version) - soybean (you will love it if u like
          injeolmi) - matcha Each bingsu comes with 3-4 toppings. U can also
          modify ur toppings. But I think the combination is already good so I
          never modify. Environment is chill and cozy, also provide drinking
          water. Overall a perfect hangout place ...

          Tried Binq for the first time and had a pleasant experience. Flavors
          were different than other bingsu places, worth trying because so far
          no other places has these flavours, it&apos;s always the same old
          thing (always green tea..oreo or yogurt) so this is something
          refreshing. Appreciate the fact that we can change toppings if we
          like. Space was quite clean, if there&apos;s any space to improve..the
          tables were a little sticky. I noticed the guy owner cleaning up
          constantly, looking around and keeping the place ...

            My 4th time being here and I love their oolong peach, soybean and

          <li>Roasted Soybean 10/10 - Slightly sweeter but balanced</li>
          <li>
            My first time trying Binq and flavors were unique and different;
            making them refreshing!
          </li>
          <li>Matcha 9/10 - Full of matcha flavour in every bite</li>
          <li>Roasted soybean oolong paired really well with cream cheese</li>
          <li>
            Perhaps one of the best bingsu in town in terms of that fine
            snowflake like texture
          </li>
          <li>
            Shaved ice was light and soybean mochi cube was springy and nicely
            paired with lots of brown sugar jelly
          </li>
          <li>One of the most delicious bingsu Iâ€™ve tried</li>
          <li>Their soya bean coated mochi cubes were absolutely delish!</li>
          <li>Roasted soybean oolong 4.75 out of 5 on flavour alone!</li>
          <li>My favourite will be their signature oolong and soya</li>
          <li>
            Tried their roasted soybean oolong and so satisfied with it. It has
            perfect fragrant, taste, and texture
