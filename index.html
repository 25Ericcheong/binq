They&#39;ve got several choices of flavour which none are too sweet so it&#39;s also a perfect place for the older audience as well. Service wise, super friendly staff especially the young couple which are actually the owners of the place! Very attentive and are also super helpful to give suggestions if you&#39;re not sure what to try."
