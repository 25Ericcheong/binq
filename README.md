# Binq Binq Binq 

Frontend project for BINQ. A one of a kind binqsu shop in Malaysia.

After pulling this project, you should be able to run `npm install` and `npm run dev`. Assuming that you already have node installed.

This project is built with Vue.js, TypeScript and TailwindCSS. 

I used these tools for fun and I've always wanted to used a CSS frameworkv like Tailwind. I used React for about 2 years and was thinking of getting some experience with Vue for fun (with TypeScript too)
